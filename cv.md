## Summary
What I like the most is the ability to create something amazing and how that ability continues to grow year after year. The web is constantly changing and improving, it is always growing. What is now possible to build in the browser wasn't even thinkable 10 years ago. I love seeing an idea come to life. From a thought to something on the screen, itâ€™s exciting journey of discovery. I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a Frontend Developer.

      let a = Infinity; 
      
      for (let i = 0; i < res.length; i++) {
      
        a = Math.min(res[i].length, a);
